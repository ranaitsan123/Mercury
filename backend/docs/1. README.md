## Recommended Workflow

1. Start with [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand the system layers and flow.
2. Read [Models](models.md) and [Signals](signals.md) to understand data relationships and automatic behaviors.
3. Explore [GraphQL API](graphql.md) for query/mutation/subscription patterns.
4. Review [Frontend Guidelines](frontend_guidelines.md) to implement compatible UI behavior.
5. Check [Tests](tests.md) to understand testing coverage and write new tests if needed.
6. Use [Deployment](deployment.md) and [Development Setup](dev_setup.md) for environment configuration.
